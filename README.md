# 🧠 Aptiverse AI Models – FastAPI Microservice for AI-Powered Learning and Student Support

The **Aptiverse AI Models** service powers the intelligence layer of the Aptiverse platform. It is a **modular FastAPI application** built with cutting-edge **Python ML and NLP libraries**, serving as the reasoning engine for understanding students’ goals, emotions, behaviors, academic struggles, and strengths.

This microservice is **asynchronous, secure, and containerized**, designed to integrate with the main `.NET 8 Aptiverse API` using **RabbitMQ**, while also supporting direct RESTful access.

## 🧠 What It Does

The engine acts like a digital academic coach and emotional support system for students.

### 📝 Diary & Emotion Analysis

* Detects stress, anxiety, trauma, burnout, motivation, and joy.
* Uses NLP to respond empathetically to students' journaling.

### 🧮 Math Image Reasoning

* Processes images of handwritten math work.
* Analyzes steps and logic using OCR + AI.
* Identifies careless mistakes vs conceptual gaps.

### 🎯 Goal Feasibility & Career Planning

* Cross-checks learner goals against university requirements.
* Provides realistic academic plans or alternative routes.

### 📊 Academic Reports

* Generates student risk/performance profiles for teachers and guardians.
* Collaborates across models for holistic insights.

### 🧪 Practice Test Generator

* Builds custom tests using South African past papers.
* Supports targeted practice by subject and difficulty.

### 🏅 Rewards System

* Encourages learner progress through gamified incentives and rewards.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local)

### 1. Clone & Set Up Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aptiverse-ai.git
cd aptiverse-ai
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Navigate to:
👉 `http://localhost:8000/docs` — interactive Swagger UI

## 🐳 Running in Docker

### Build and Run Container

```bash
docker build -t aptiverse-ai .
docker run -p 8000:8000 aptiverse-ai
```

### Or use Docker Compose (includes PostgreSQL)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/aptiverse
  db:
    image: postgres:15
